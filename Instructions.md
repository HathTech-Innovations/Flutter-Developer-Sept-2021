# HathTech's Hiring: Flutter Developer

### Instructions
1. Create a fork of this project.
2. Design the following screen: 
<br/><br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vGgZHMs.jpeg" alt="Design" width="500"/><br/><br/>
3. Breakdown screen into multiple widgets. 
4. Please avoid using literals or copying the widget. Try to store data in variables or use a JSON file that contains the data. Use a state management library like Provider (Change Notifier), BLOC etc. to pass around the data.
5. Keep you code clean, maintain a file structure and add neccessary comments.
6. Once done, push the code to the fork of this repository that you created.

### Evaluation Criteria
- Design - how close it is to the provided screens
- Responsiveness (optional to add) will be considered as a plus
- Understanding of Provider, BLOC etc. (State Management) used, expressed in your code
- Separation of Design into Widgets and Screen (Modularity)
- Code readability
- Code maintainability
